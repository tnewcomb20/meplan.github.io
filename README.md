# CS-299 Group 8 : MEPLAN

## Project Pitch or Proposal (Deliverable #1)

### Background: 

 Students often find it challenging to keep up with daily tasks, including homework, project deadlines, extracurricular, club meetings, and grades. The struggle to balance all these responsibilities can result in stress, missed deadlines, and etc. 
 
 Our team is committed to building "Meplan" a user-friendly website to address this issue. Our goal with Meplan is to make students' lives easier by helping them manage their responsibilities more effectively.

## Observations:

By addressing these potential problems with appropriate solutions, "Meplan" can offer students a more efficient and user-friendly experience in managing their daily tasks and responsibilities.

**Lack of Task Prioritization:** Students might struggle to prioritize tasks effectively, leading to poor time management.
  
   - **Solution:** Incorporate a task prioritization algorithm that helps students categorize and rank assignments by urgency and importance. Provide visual cues for prioritized tasks.

**Overwhelming Notifications:** Excessive or poorly timed notifications could overwhelm students.
  
   - **Solution:** Allow users to customize notification settings, specifying the type, frequency, and timing of notifications to suit their preferences.

**Inflexibility in Calendar Management:** Students may need to adapt to last-minute schedule changes, which the calendar doesn't easily accommodate.
 
   - **Solution:** Enable drag-and-drop functionality in the calendar, offer an "adjust schedule" option, and provide clear visual cues for rescheduled tasks.


## Personas and Use case scenario:

Notion workspace: Current form is very uniform and generic with every part looking near identical and taking up the same amount of visual space. We could improve on this by tailoring it more to students specifically and allowing for more important items to be visually distinct, such as with tests or projects being larger or a different color, etc.

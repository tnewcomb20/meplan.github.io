# CS-299 Group 8 : MEPLAN

### Background: 

 Students often find it challenging to keep up with daily tasks, including homework, project deadlines, extracurricular, club meetings, and grades. The struggle to balance all these responsibilities can result in stress, missed deadlines, and etc. 
 
 Our team is committed to building "Meplan" a user-friendly website to address this issue. Our goal with Meplan is to make students' lives easier by helping them manage their responsibilities more effectively.

## Project Pitch or Proposal (Deliverable #1)

## Observations:

• These observations highlight several pain points experienced by students when it comes to organizing their daily activities, including the use of various tools, difficulty in prioritization, and adapting to changes in their schedules. These insights will be valuable when designing a website that addresses these issues and provides a user-friendly solution for students to manage their tasks, deadlines, grades, club activities, and more efficiently

### User 1: Emma (College Student)

• **Notifications**: Sarah wakes up and checks her phone for notifications. She scrolls through multiple apps to find information about her daily tasks.

• **Task Prioritization**: She writes down her homework assignments in a notebook but struggles to prioritize them. She spends a considerable amount of time figuring out which tasks are more urgent.

• **Club Activities**: In the evening, she rushes to her extracurricular club meetings. She often forgets the meeting time and sometimes misses them.

### Solutions:

**Notifications and Reminders:**

"Meplan" can send push notifications to Sarah with her daily task and club meeting reminders.
She can customize reminders for different tasks and activities.
Notifications can include details like meeting time and homework deadlines, reducing the need to search through various apps.

**Task Prioritization:**

"Meplan" provides a task prioritization feature where Sarah can set the urgency and importance of her assignments.
The website can automatically sort tasks based on priority, helping her focus on the most critical ones first.

**Club Activities:**

Sarah can input her club meetings into "Meplan," specifying the date, time, and location.
The website can send her reminders well in advance to ensure she doesn't forget the meeting time.
"Meplan" could also provide a calendar view that displays both academic and extracurricular commitments in one place for easy reference.
By using "Meplan," Sarah can streamline her daily tasks, receive timely reminders, and prioritize her work effectively, resulting in better time management and fewer missed club meetings and assignments.

### User 2: John (College Student)

• **Digital Tools**: John primarily relies on digital tools. He uses a combination of a calendar app, a task management app, and a note-taking app to organize his tasks.

• **Deadline Tracking**: He often forgets upcoming deadlines and has to check multiple apps to ensure he hasn't missed any assignments.

• **Grade Monitoring**: John spends a lot of time calculating his grades and planning how to improve them. He manually enters grade information into spreadsheets.

### Solutions:

**Automated Deadline Tracking:**
   - "Meplan" can automatically sync with John's assignment due dates and deadlines.
     
   - The application can send him timely notifications and reminders for upcoming tasks and assignments, eliminating the risk of forgetting important deadlines.

**Grade Monitoring and Calculation:**

   - "Meplan" can include a grade tracking feature where John can input his course grades.
    
   - The app can calculate his GPA and display it. This feature would save John time and effort in manually calculating and tracking his grades in spreadsheets.

By integrating John's preferred digital tools, automating deadline tracking, and providing a GPA calculation feature, "Meplan" can offer him a more efficient and streamlined way to manage his academic responsibilities and improve his overall organization.

### User 3: Maria (Graduate Student)

• **Complex Schedule**: Maria's schedule is very complex. She juggles coursework, part-time work, research projects, and social activities. She uses a physical planner to keep track of everything.

• **Deadline Pressure**: She frequently feels overwhelmed as she balances various responsibilities. Her planner helps her see overlapping deadlines.

• **Adapting to Changes**: Maria often has last-minute changes to her schedule due to research experiments or work meetings. She struggles to update her planner effectively.

### Solutions:

**Deadline Visualization:**

"Meplan" offers a visual calendar that displays all of Maria's tasks, projects, and commitments.
Overlapping deadlines are highlighted, helping her identify busy periods and plan effectively.


**Real-Time Updates:**

The application allows Maria to make quick updates to her schedule when last-minute changes occur. She can easily reschedule tasks, appointments, and activities, ensuring her planner remains accurate and up-to-date.

**Notification and Reminder System:**

"Meplan" offers customizable notifications and reminders for upcoming deadlines, meetings, and events.
Maria can set alerts to keep her on track and minimize feelings of overwhelm.
Collaboration and Sharing:

By adopting "Meplan," Maria can transition to a digital schedule management system that offers real-time updates, visual deadline tracking, and improved adaptability to last-minute changes. This shift can significantly reduce feelings of overwhelm and improve her overall time management.

Notion workspace: Current form is very uniform and generic with every part looking near identical and taking up the same amount of visual space. We could improve on this by tailoring it more to students specifically and allowing for more important items to be visually distinct, such as with tests or projects being larger or a different color, etc.


## Product comparison:

• 

## High-level design:

• 

## Feasibility:

• Designing a website that aids in assignment and project management through a user-friendly interface, connected to a database, is within the project scope.

# Project Pitch or Proposal (Deliverable #1)

## Background: 

Keeping track of daily tasks can be difficult for students, we intend to create a website to help students keep track of their daily activities such as homework, deadlines, grades, clubs, and ect.

## Observations:
• complete and clear descriptions of users' behavior
Students 
These observations highlight several pain points experienced by students when it comes to organizing their daily activities, including the use of various tools, difficulty in prioritization, and adapting to changes in their schedules. These insights will be valuable when designing a website that addresses these issues and provides a user-friendly solution for students to manage their tasks, deadlines, grades, club activities, and more efficiently
Problem:
• good description of problem related to observations

## Personas:

### User 1: Emma (College Student)

1. Morning Routine Observation: Sarah wakes up and checks her phone for notifications. She scrolls through multiple apps to find information about her daily tasks.
2. Task Prioritization: She writes down her homework assignments in a notebook but struggles to prioritize them. She spends a considerable amount of time figuring out which tasks are more urgent.
3.Club Activities: In the evening, she rushes to her extracurricular club meetings. She often forgets the meeting time and sometimes misses them.

### User 2: John (College Student)

1.Digital Tools: John primarily relies on digital tools. He uses a combination of a calendar app, a task management app, and a note-taking app to organize his tasks.
2. Deadline Tracking: He often forgets upcoming deadlines and has to check multiple apps to ensure he hasn't missed any assignments.
3. Grade Monitoring: John spends a lot of time calculating his grades and planning how to improve them. He manually enters grade information into spreadsheets.

### User 3: Maria (Graduate Student)

1. Complex Schedule: Maria's schedule is very complex. She juggles coursework, part-time work, research projects, and social activities. She uses a physical planner to keep track of everything.

2. Deadline Pressure: She frequently feels overwhelmed as she balances various responsibilities. Her planner helps her see overlapping deadlines.
3.Adapting to Changes: Maria often has last-minute changes to her schedule due to research experiments or work meetings. She struggles to update her planner effectively.

## Use-case:

does not identify persona
does not address how the system solves the persona's
needs
use-case bears more semblance to a user manual than a
story (i.e. no context was given)

## Related products:

Notion workspace: Current form is very uniform and generic with every part looking near identical and taking up the same amount of visual space. We could improve on this by tailoring it more to students specifically and allowing for more important items to be visually distinct, such as with tests or projects being larger or a different color, etc.


## Product comparison:

only identified why proposed system was technically
more simple
did not identify why product is a better fit for personas
described earlier
High-level design:
diagram is reasonably clear but lacks detail about
functionality of application
paragraph description was necessary for me to
understand
specific technologies need not be identified (e.g. Parse
Core, Android)
Feasibility:
Ability to create a usable website and connect it to a database to store and use information about different assignments 
 projects and display it in a visually useful manner for users to interact with

# Deliverable #2: Low fidelity prototype 3

## Usability Goals:

1. The system should be easy for students to learn and navigate, minimizing the learning curve.
   - Usability Goal: New users should be able to perform essential tasks within 30 minutes of use.

2. Efficiency: The system should enable students to manage their assignments and tasks efficiently.
   - Usability Goal: Users should be able to add a new assignment, set a due date, and categorize it in under 2 minutes.

3. Error Minimization: The system should prevent common user errors in task management.
   - Usability Goal: Users should make no more than 2 errors while using the system in a 30-minute session.

4. User Satisfaction: The system should provide a positive user experience and meet the needs of students.
   - Usability Goal: Users should rate their overall satisfaction with the system at an average of 4 or above on a 5-point Likert scale.

5. Task Completion: Users should be able to complete common tasks without difficulty.
   - Usability Goal: 90% of users should successfully complete the following tasks within a set time frame:
     - Add a new assignment
     - Set a due date
     - Categorize an assignment
     - Mark an assignment as complete

## Benchmark Tasks:

1. Add a New Assignment:
   - Task: User should add a new assignment to the system.
   - Success Criteria: User successfully adds an assignment with a title, description, and due date.

2. Set a Due Date:
   - Task: User should set a due date for an existing assignment.
   - Success Criteria: User successfully assigns a due date to an assignment.

3. Categorize an Assignment:
   - Task: User should categorize an assignment into a specific subject or course.
   - Success Criteria: User successfully assigns an assignment to a specific category.

4. Mark an Assignment as Complete:
   - Task: User should mark an assignment as complete.
   - Success Criteria: User successfully marks an assignment as complete, and it is visually indicated as such in the system.

5. Search for an Assignment:
   - Task: User should search for a specific assignment within the system.
   - Success Criteria: User successfully finds the assignment they were searching for.

6. View Upcoming Assignments:
   - Task: User should view a list of upcoming assignments and their due dates.
   - Success Criteria: User can easily access a list of upcoming assignments and their due dates.

7. User Registration and Profile Setup:
   - Task: New user should register on the website and set up their profile.
   - Success Criteria: User completes the registration process and sets up their profile without encountering difficulties.

8. Receive Assignment Reminders:
   - Task: User should set up assignment reminders or notifications.
   - Success Criteria: User successfully configures assignment reminders and receives a test notification.

9. Sync with Calendar:
   - Task: User should sync their assignment due dates with their personal calendar (e.g., Google Calendar).
   - Success Criteria: User can integrate their assignment due dates with an external calendar successfully.

10. Export/Print Assignment List:
    - Task: User should be able to export or print a list of assignments for offline use.
    - Success Criteria: User can generate a printable or exportable assignment list without difficulty.

These usability goals and benchmark tasks will help evaluate the planner/tracker website's user-friendliness and functionality, ensuring it meets the needs of its target user population effectively.

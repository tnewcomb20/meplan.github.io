# CS-299 Group 8 : MEPLAN

### Background: 

 Students often find it challenging to keep up with daily tasks, including homework, project deadlines, extracurricular, club meetings, and grades. The struggle to balance all these responsibilities can result in stress, missed deadlines,and etc. 
 
 Our team is committed to building "Meplan," a user-friendly website, to address this issue. Our goal with Meplan is to make students' lives easier by helping them manage their responsibilities more effectively.

## Project Pitch or Proposal (Deliverable #1)

## Observations:
• complete and clear descriptions of users' behavior
Students 
These observations highlight several pain points experienced by students when it comes to organizing their daily activities, including the use of various tools, difficulty in prioritization, and adapting to changes in their schedules. These insights will be valuable when designing a website that addresses these issues and provides a user-friendly solution for students to manage their tasks, deadlines, grades, club activities, and more efficiently
Problem:
• good description of problem related to observations

## Personas:

### User 1: Emma (College Student)

1. Morning Routine Observation: Sarah wakes up and checks her phone for notifications. She scrolls through multiple apps to find information about her daily tasks.
2. Task Prioritization: She writes down her homework assignments in a notebook but struggles to prioritize them. She spends a considerable amount of time figuring out which tasks are more urgent.
3.Club Activities: In the evening, she rushes to her extracurricular club meetings. She often forgets the meeting time and sometimes misses them.

### User 2: John (College Student)

1.Digital Tools: John primarily relies on digital tools. He uses a combination of a calendar app, a task management app, and a note-taking app to organize his tasks.
2. Deadline Tracking: He often forgets upcoming deadlines and has to check multiple apps to ensure he hasn't missed any assignments.
3. Grade Monitoring: John spends a lot of time calculating his grades and planning how to improve them. He manually enters grade information into spreadsheets.

### User 3: Maria (Graduate Student)

1. Complex Schedule: Maria's schedule is very complex. She juggles coursework, part-time work, research projects, and social activities. She uses a physical planner to keep track of everything.

2. Deadline Pressure: She frequently feels overwhelmed as she balances various responsibilities. Her planner helps her see overlapping deadlines.
3.Adapting to Changes: Maria often has last-minute changes to her schedule due to research experiments or work meetings. She struggles to update her planner effectively.

## Use-case:

does not identify persona
does not address how the system solves the persona's
needs
use-case bears more semblance to a user manual than a
story (i.e. no context was given)

Notion workspace: Current form is very uniform and generic with every part looking near identical and taking up the same amount of visual space. We could improve on this by tailoring it more to students specifically and allowing for more important items to be visually distinct, such as with tests or projects being larger or a different color, etc.


## Product comparison:

only identified why proposed system was technically
more simple
did not identify why product is a better fit for personas
described earlier
High-level design:
diagram is reasonably clear but lacks detail about
functionality of application
paragraph description was necessary for me to
understand
specific technologies need not be identified (e.g. Parse
Core, Android)
Feasibility:
Ability to create a usable website and connect it to a database to store and use information about different assignments 
 projects and display it in a visually useful manner for users to interact with

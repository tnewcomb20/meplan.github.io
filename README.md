## Project Pitch or Proposal (Deliverable #1)

Background:
Keeping track of daily tasks can be difficult for students, we intend to create a website to help students keep track of their daily activities such as homework, deadlines, grades, clubs, and ect.

A description of our intended user population

Aim for students

Why we think that we could develop a prototype solution with a relatively modest amount of implementation effort

We donâ€™t aim to recreate a full-fledged planner web app; that would indeed entail too many features and take too long. We do intend to make a basic one, however, with a few key features which address our problem.

a brief overview of any existing solution (if there are) and aspects we are improving upon.

Notion workspace: Current form is very uniform and generic with every part looking near identical and taking up the same amount of visual space. We could improve on this by tailoring it more to students specifically and allowing for more important items to be visually distinct, such as with tests or projects being larger or a different color, etc.

a summary of the software, hardware, and other skills that we expect to need in team members to accomplish the project

Ability to create a usable website and connect it to a database to store and use information about different assignments / projects and display it in a visually useful manner for users to interact with.

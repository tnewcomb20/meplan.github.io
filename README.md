## Project Pitch or Proposal (Deliverable #1)

Background:
Keeping track of daily tasks can be difficult for students, we intend to create a website to help students keep track of their daily activities such as homework, deadlines, grades, clubs, and ect.

A description of our intended user population

Aim for students

Why we think that we could develop a prototype solution with a relatively modest amount of implementation effort

We don’t aim to recreate a full-fledged planner web app; that would indeed entail too many features and take too long. We do intend to make a basic one, however, with a few key features which address our problem.

a brief overview of any existing solution (if there are) and aspects we are improving upon.

Notion workspace: Current form is very uniform and generic with every part looking near identical and taking up the same amount of visual space. We could improve on this by tailoring it more to students specifically and allowing for more important items to be visually distinct, such as with tests or projects being larger or a different color, etc.

a summary of the software, hardware, and other skills that we expect to need in team members to accomplish the project

Ability to create a usable website and connect it to a database to store and use information about different assignments / projects and display it in a visually useful manner for users to interact with.

### Deliverable #2: Low fidelity prototype 3

Sure, here's an outline for usability goals and benchmark tasks for a planner/tracker website designed for students to track their assignments:

**Usability Goals:**

1. **Ease of Use**: The system should be easy for students to learn and navigate, minimizing the learning curve.
   - Usability Goal: New users should be able to perform essential tasks within 30 minutes of use.

2. **Efficiency**: The system should enable students to manage their assignments and tasks efficiently.
   - Usability Goal: Users should be able to add a new assignment, set a due date, and categorize it in under 2 minutes.

3. **Error Minimization**: The system should prevent common user errors in task management.
   - Usability Goal: Users should make no more than 2 errors while using the system in a 30-minute session.

4. **User Satisfaction**: The system should provide a positive user experience and meet the needs of students.
   - Usability Goal: Users should rate their overall satisfaction with the system at an average of 4 or above on a 5-point Likert scale.

5. **Task Completion**: Users should be able to complete common tasks without difficulty.
   - Usability Goal: 90% of users should successfully complete the following tasks within a set time frame:
     - Add a new assignment
     - Set a due date
     - Categorize an assignment
     - Mark an assignment as complete

**Benchmark Tasks:**

1. **Add a New Assignment**:
   - Task: User should add a new assignment to the system.
   - Success Criteria: User successfully adds an assignment with a title, description, and due date.

2. **Set a Due Date**:
   - Task: User should set a due date for an existing assignment.
   - Success Criteria: User successfully assigns a due date to an assignment.

3. **Categorize an Assignment**:
   - Task: User should categorize an assignment into a specific subject or course.
   - Success Criteria: User successfully assigns an assignment to a specific category.

4. **Mark an Assignment as Complete**:
   - Task: User should mark an assignment as complete.
   - Success Criteria: User successfully marks an assignment as complete, and it is visually indicated as such in the system.

5. **Search for an Assignment**:
   - Task: User should search for a specific assignment within the system.
   - Success Criteria: User successfully finds the assignment they were searching for.

6. **View Upcoming Assignments**:
   - Task: User should view a list of upcoming assignments and their due dates.
   - Success Criteria: User can easily access a list of upcoming assignments and their due dates.

7. **User Registration and Profile Setup**:
   - Task: New user should register on the website and set up their profile.
   - Success Criteria: User completes the registration process and sets up their profile without encountering difficulties.

8. **Receive Assignment Reminders**:
   - Task: User should set up assignment reminders or notifications.
   - Success Criteria: User successfully configures assignment reminders and receives a test notification.

9. **Sync with Calendar**:
   - Task: User should sync their assignment due dates with their personal calendar (e.g., Google Calendar).
   - Success Criteria: User can integrate their assignment due dates with an external calendar successfully.

10. **Export/Print Assignment List**:
    - Task: User should be able to export or print a list of assignments for offline use.
    - Success Criteria: User can generate a printable or exportable assignment list without difficulty.

These usability goals and benchmark tasks will help evaluate the planner/tracker website's user-friendliness and functionality, ensuring it meets the needs of its target user population effectively.
